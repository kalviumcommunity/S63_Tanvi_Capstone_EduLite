EduLite
Simple Institute Management System
________________________________________
Project Description
EduLite is a lightweight and easy-to-use web-based Institute Management System built using the MERN stack. It is designed to help educational institutions manage essential operations such as student records, course information, and fee payments efficiently. The system consists of two main dashboards: one for administrators and one for students. Admins can add courses, manage student data, and track fee payments, while students can view their course enrollments and fee statuses.

Problem Statement
Many small and mid-sized educational institutions still rely on manual processes to manage students, courses, and fees. This can lead to disorganized data, human errors, delayed fee tracking, and an overall inefficient administrative workflow. There is a need for a simple and intuitive digital solution to automate these routine tasks.
________________________________________
Solution
EduLite provides a streamlined web platform where admin users can manage all institutional data in one place. It simplifies course management, student registrations, and fee tracking, helping educational institutes reduce administrative workload. Meanwhile, students have access to their course information and payment history through a dedicated dashboard.
